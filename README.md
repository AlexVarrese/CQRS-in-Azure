CQRS in Azure
==========================
This is a simple example showing a nice CQRS application running inside of Windows Azure.

I'm using three projects to accomplish different areas of the application.

[Lokad CQRS](http://code.google.com/p/lokad-cqrs/)
--------------
This is a great service bus written for Windows Azure. Very well written code and very active.

[CommonDomain](https://github.com/joliver/CommonDomain)
--------------
For DDD style semantics

[EventStore](https://github.com/joliver/EventStore)
--------------
A very configurable Event Store.
